# Worker Ledger

The manager owns the integration branch. Implementation workers use separate
worktrees, Luna/max, one minimal responsibility, and return reviewable commits.
Review workers use Sol/ultra and do not implement fixes.

## Message protocol

```text
REQUEST <id>
from / to / blocking / context / question / expected evidence

RESPONSE <id>
from / to / conclusion / evidence / affected files or commit / next action
```

The manager records and forwards all cross-worker messages here before acting.

## Planning workers

### W-DESIGN-A - Minimal interface

- Thread: `019fcdde-694b-70d1-a0fb-4cbf24f41356`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`, `max`
- Initial wait: timed out; completed after one follow-up.
- Response: packed feature/target matrices, only `process` and `reset`.
- Decision: rejected because lag feature construction leaked algorithm knowledge
  into the mne_scan adapter.

### W-DESIGN-B - Extensible interface

- Thread: `019fcdde-8159-7b60-b896-439b127eb431`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`, `max`
- Initial wait: timed out; completed after one follow-up.
- Response: `IStreamAlgorithm`, typed settings, model layer, and registry.
- Decision: rejected as a hypothetical seam with only one v1 algorithm.

### W-DESIGN-C - Caller-first interface

- Thread: `019fcdde-a032-7640-8e86-b71d00375642`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`, `max`
- Response: concrete full-block `CausalReferenceDenoiser` owning lag and EWLS
  state with safe status results.
- Decision: selected, with controls compressed using A's minimal-interface goal.

### Replacement attempts

- Threads: `019fcdeb-3418-7592-9fdf-85d019a04bc7`,
  `019fcdeb-3e5b-7e13-9786-e2822fbfc1e6`
- Reason: dispatched when A/B had exceeded their first follow-up timeout.
- Status: not used; original A/B later completed. They must not influence code.

## Execution queue

1. `W-TEST-CORE`: numerical TDD tracer bullets.
2. `W-CORE`: Eigen implementation.
3. `R-CORE`: Sol/ultra numerical and real-time review.
4. `W-PLUGIN-DATA`: FIFF adapter and adapter tests.
5. `W-PLUGIN-UI`: controls and diagnostics.
6. `W-EXAMPLE-DOC`: example, benchmark, and learning documentation.
7. `R-INTEGRATION`: Sol/ultra final review.

## Execution workers

### REQUEST W-TEST-CORE-001

- From / to: manager / `W-TEST-CORE`
- Thread: `019fcdfb-9c01-7bb2-88a1-7af4a5621a0d`
- Client setup ID: `client-new-thread:2f7a3181-c13c-4df2-a1f1-4e7d6ed1aa4c`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`, `max`
- Worktree base: `codex/causal-reference-denoising`
- Blocking: yes, for `W-CORE`.
- Task: add exactly one public-interface RED tracer bullet for valid configure
  followed by `BypassTrackHistory`, plus the focused CMake target. Do not add
  production code or further behavioral tests.
- Required response: commit SHA, changed files, narrow RED command and failure
  evidence, beginning `RESPONSE W-TEST-CORE-001`.
- Status: active in worktree `C:/Users/lcy/.codex/worktrees/76e7/mne-cpp-main`.

### REQUEST W-TEST-CORE-001-INFRA

- From / to: manager / `W-TEST-CORE`
- Blocking: no; narrows validation responsibility.
- Evidence: the clean worktree lacks Eigen files such as
  `Eigen/src/Core/util/Macros.h` and `scripts/buildtests.in`. They are ignored
  but present in the main workspace; this is not a configured submodule.
- Decision: do not copy, link, stage, or repair the third-party Eigen tree.
  Commit only the requested test/CMake changes and report the infrastructure
  configure failure separately. The manager will cherry-pick the commit and
  reproduce the intended missing-production-header RED in the main workspace.
- Status: forwarded and followed; temporary dependency/build files were removed.

### RESPONSE W-TEST-CORE-001

- Commit: `79cbd1752d2d8501786a007c2e02bedbb7d5057f`
- Changed files: top-level testframe list, focused test CMake, one Qt test source.
- Contract: valid configuration returns `DenoiserStatus::Configured`;
  `BypassTrackHistory` returns `DenoiserProcessStatus::Bypassed` in
  `DenoiserProcessResult::status` and preserves the complete matrix.
- Test count: one Qt slot; no production files added.
- Worker validation: clean-worktree configure failed before target generation
  because of the documented ignored Eigen baseline files. Intended RED not
  claimed.
- Manager review: patch is scoped and matches the repository's current Qt test
  CMake convention. Accepted for cherry-pick; manager must reproduce RED.

### REQUEST W-TEST-CORE-001-REVISE

- From / to: manager / `W-TEST-CORE`
- Evidence: after cherry-pick, focused target generation succeeded, but the
  copied legacy test CMake linked the full MNE dependency set. MSVC 2026 failed
  in unrelated Qt 5.15 / `mne_fiff` code before compiling the tracer test.
- Required change: make this Eigen-only numerical test target link only Qt
  Core/Test and `eigen`, and add only the `src/libraries` include root needed
  for `<rtprocessing/...>`. Do not link `mne_rtprocessing` or other MNE/3D/UI
  libraries in this tracer target. Keep the single test and no production code.
- Required response: a new commit and exact changed CMake evidence, beginning
  `RESPONSE W-TEST-CORE-001-REVISE`.
- Status: completed.

### RESPONSE W-TEST-CORE-001-REVISE

- Commit: `76fbc02ad628ba8e0e2f5a76e305b39e4a50e505`
- Change: reduced Qt dependencies to Core/Test, removed all MNE library links,
  retained `eigen`, and added `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/libraries` as the only local
  include root.
- Manager review: one-file focused diff; accepted for cherry-pick.

### MANAGER VALIDATION W-TEST-CORE-001-RED

- Integrated commits: `59537fdd6` and `650338f19`.
- Configure: focused MSVC 2026 / Qt 5.15 build generation succeeded.
- RED command: `cmake --build build-causal-reference-denoising --target
  test_causal_reference_denoiser --config Release -- /m:2`.
- Expected failure: MSVC `C1083`, missing
  `rtprocessing/causalreferencedenoiser.h` while compiling the tracer source.
- Result: valid RED accepted; `W-CORE` may begin.

### REQUEST W-CORE-001

- From / to: manager / `W-CORE`.
- Client setup ID: `client-new-thread:719101fb-b9e7-4b6f-99ae-7f77dca31fe6`.
- Thread: `019fce0e-59ad-7ce1-91a3-db5f4fd233e8`.
- Worktree: `C:/Users/lcy/.codex/worktrees/ef9b/mne-cpp-main`.
- Model/environment: `gpt-5.6-luna`, `max`, new worktree from the current
  integration branch.
- Blocking: yes, for every later core behavior.
- Context: the one-slot tracer currently fails only because
  `<rtprocessing/causalreferencedenoiser.h>` is absent.
- Task: add the minimum Eigen/STL production header/source and CMake wiring to
  make the existing valid-config plus `BypassTrackHistory` tracer GREEN.
  Preserve the entire input block and expose the tracer's fixed public status
  names. Do not add a second test or implement the EWLS algorithm yet.
- Required discipline: read the durable records in recovery order; use the
  `codebase-design` and `tdd` skills; keep the focused test isolated from the
  full MNE/FIFF/UI dependency graph; do not repair or vendor the ignored Eigen
  baseline in the clean worktree.
- Required response: `RESPONSE W-CORE-001`, commit SHA, changed files, focused
  command/evidence available in the worktree, limitations, and next suggested
  single RED behavior.
- Status: active in the isolated worktree.
